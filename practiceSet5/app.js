// 2.difference between null and undefined with example

/* null and undefined are quite same they represent absence of values , but still they are different some how:
 /NULL/:
 null represents clearly to no value ,
 we use null to clear a reference of a value etc.*/
let variable = null;
console.log(variable);
// null  is intensional ;

/*
 /undefined /
 it's use case is that when we donot initialize certain variable or function we get the undefined value .
 */

let x;
console.log(x);
function doSomething() {}
// these will return undefined.

//==> as per i can say null is intentional and Undefined is non intentional .
